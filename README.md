# Safety Riding

## Project Overview
Safety Riding is a web application designed to facilitate safe riding education. The application allows users to log in and access various modules that teach essential safety riding skills, including basic safety principles, effective braking techniques, hazard anticipation, and awareness of microsleep dangers while riding.

## Installation
To set up the Safety Riding application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/safety-riding.git
   cd safety-riding
   ```

2. **Open the HTML files**:
   You can open the `index.html` file in a web browser to access the login page, or navigate to other HTML files (`dashboard.html`, `analytics.html`) for respective functionalities. There is no need for a local server for this basic application.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter your `NPK`, `Nama`, and `Bagian` in the login form and click the "Login" button.
3. Upon successful login, you will be directed to the dashboard where various modules are available.
4. Each module can be clicked to learn more about its contents.
5. The analytics page provides statistical insights into user performance and departmental access.

## Features
- User-friendly login interface.
- Responsive design built with Tailwind CSS for optimal performance on mobile and desktop devices.
- Multiple learning modules on safety riding techniques.
- Dynamic user dashboard to track learning progress.
